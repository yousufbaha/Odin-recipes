    <h2><p>Description</p></h2>
    Delicious crispy shrimp coated in a bread crumb-Parmesan mixture. My family can't get enough of it! I would suggest doubling the recipe if you have very large eaters because this is addictive! Serve with pasta and salad.
    <h2><p>Ingredients</p></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Non-stick Cooking Spray</li>
        <li>1 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 pound large shrimp</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter,melted,or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch glass casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray.</p></li>
           
            <li><p>Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, and garlic powder in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal and shake to mix ingredients together. Add shrimp and shake to coat.</p></li>
           
            <li><p>Lay shrimp flat in the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with any bread crumb mixture remaining in the bag. Drizzle melted butter over the top. </p></li>
           
            <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until starting to crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Switch to broil setting until topping is light brown, 2 to 3 minutes.</p> </li>
